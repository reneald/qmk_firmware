# Reneald's keymap for Redox
Just a simple keymap with a few changes to the default layout

## Changes
* Added F11 and F12 to _SYMB layer (yay full screen)
* Added Num Lock to _SYMB layer (the first PC I connected this keyboard to had Num Lock disabled and I didn't have another keyboard at hand so I couldn't use the num pad at all)
* Replaced one MO(_SYMB) key with TG(_SYMB) for easier numpad use
* Removed _NAV layer completely
* Switched UP and DOWN keys around because that makes more sense in my head
* Added volume controls on _ADJUST layer
* added _INTEL layer with some shortcuts for IntelliJ IDEA

## To Do
* Figure out what to do with left hand keys in _SYMB. Repeating symbols that I already can find on the default layer seems redundant.
